# Contrast-Enhanced Mammography: From Image to Conditioned Generative Reports

**A hybrid classification and generation pipeline for contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM). Each component was tested for what it can and can't actually do, instead of assuming a general-purpose model would handle all of it.**

> Trained and evaluated on the public [CDD-CESM dataset](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01238-0) (Khaled et al., *Scientific Data*, 2022). Research prototype only, not a diagnostic device, not clinically validated.

## Overview

The first version asked a general vision-language model to read the category (Benign, Suspicious, or Malignant) straight from the image. It was right only 12–24% of the time, and it kept over-calling the worst category, Malignant, about 8x too often. So a dedicated classifier was trained for this task instead (ConvNeXtV2-tiny), which reached 97% agreement with the real category on unseen data.

A second test checked whether the LLM's written description actually matched the image, or just the category label. Two different real images, given the same category, produced descriptions that were 74% identical in wording. So the roles were split: the classifier decides the category, the LLM only writes descriptive text to match it, and the app makes that split clear to the reader.

## Quickstart (deploying the app)

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Docker, an Anthropic API key, the CDD-CESM dataset and trained checkpoints (see [Data & checkpoints](#data--checkpoints)).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WalidGhorbel/cesm-report-generation.git 
cd cesm-report-generation
uv sync
cp .env.example .env              # add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
docker compose up -d              # starts Qdrant (retrieval component)
streamlit run app.py              # opens at localhost:8501
```

### Data & checkpoints

This repo doesn't include the dataset or trained weights (licensing and size):

- **Dataset**: [CDD-CESM on TCIA](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01238-0), images, reports, and annotations.
- **Checkpoints**: 4 trained classifiers (`best_birads_{dm,cesm}.pt`, `best_cancer_{dm,cesm}.pt`). Train these yourself with the classifier notebook, or point `CHECKPOINT_DIR` in `app.py` at existing ones.

## Using the app

1. **Select a case.** Load a bundled example (it ships with real ground truth, so the model's output can be checked live against an actual radiologist's report), or upload your own Low Energy (LE) or Dual-Energy Subtracted (DES) breast image.

   ![Case selection sidebar](screenshots/01-case-selection.png)

2. **Generate the Low Energy (LE) report.** One button runs both breasts at once. The image shown is the exact 1024×1024 preprocessed input the model receives, not the raw file.

   ![LE images loaded, ready to generate](screenshots/02-le-images.png)

   ![Generate LE report button](screenshots/02b-generate-button.png)

   Each result shows the classifier's category (color-coded, with confidence) and the LLM's illustrative narrative. For bundled examples, it also shows the real radiologist's finding next to it, with a **✓ MATCH / ✗ MISMATCH** badge, the fastest way to see actual accuracy instead of taking it on faith.

   ![Real finding vs. generated output, with match badges](screenshots/03-real-vs-generated.png)

   A Grad-CAM attention overlay appears beneath each image. See [Validation & Known Limitations](#validation--known-limitations) for what it does and doesn't reliably show.

3. **Generate the Contrast-Enhanced (DES) report.** Same pattern, run second. This matches how the source reports are structured: an LE assessment first, then a separate contrast-enhanced assessment.
4. **Review the combined report.** A plain-text view matching the original dataset's report format.

## Known Limitations

**Grad-CAM location is only partly reliable.** Gradient-based attention maps can highlight dominant image edges instead of the exact region driving a prediction. This is a known characteristic of the technique in general, not something specific to this model. Testing against 3 known-location cases found the same pattern here: the vertical (upper/lower) axis matched the real finding in 2 out of 2 cases, but the horizontal axis consistently leaned toward the chest-wall edge. The app shows the raw heatmap for human interpretation and doesn't generate location claims from it.

The narrative text is illustrative, not a visual read. A controlled test held the predicted category fixed and varied the input image; the generated description tracked the category label more than the image itself. The interface labels all narrative text accordingly, on purpose.

ACR breast density and the individual BI-RADS digit or subcategory (4A vs. 4B, for example) are both out of scope. The classifier predicts the coarse category, Benign, Suspicious, or Malignant, and nothing finer than that.
